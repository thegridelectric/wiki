# Changelog

A reverse-chronological log of WHY we made each commit. The matching git
commit (in the `sema` repo) holds the WHAT (the diff). Each entry's date and
one-line title should mirror the corresponding commit so the two can be
cross-referenced.

## 2026-05-21 — Add gw / gridworks.header envelope Sema types; fix Dst; regenerate

**Why:** Register the GridWorks application-layer **envelope** as Sema
vocabulary. `gridworks.header/001` (literal) captures the delivery metadata
(`Src`, `Dst`, `MessageType`, `MessageId`, `AckRequired`) exactly as emitted by
the field-deployed gwproto Header wire format; `gw` (versionless) is the
envelope = header + an opaque `Payload` (any registered Sema type, matched by
`TypeName`). These are the types the gridworks-base **codec layer** wraps for
multi-hop traversal (see
`wiki/gridworks-base/executor/codec.md`). Fixed a schema bug — `gridworks.header/001`'s
`Dst` had no `type` (added `type: string`). Also removed an orphaned
`heartbeat_a_000_to_001` upgrade template left behind by the heartbeat change
below (it referenced the deleted v001 and failed two tests). Full suite green.
The header doc records a deliberate v002 evolution path (drop empty-string
sentinels, drop redundant `MessageType`, constrain `Dst`, add instance
provenance / signing).

## 2026-05-21 — heartbeat.a: delete unpublished v001, revert latest_version to 000, document supervisor use (`359f5b5`)

**Why:** An unpublished `heartbeat.a/001` had *deleted* the `MyHex`/`YourLastHex`
pair. That pair is the supervisor-tier liveness/continuity primitive — the names
are **sender-relative** (`MyHex` = sender's fresh token, `YourLastHex` echoes the
peer's last), so one type serves both the supervisor and the supervised actor;
it must not be dropped, and must not be renamed to a role-specific "SuHex."
Pre-publication revise-in-place is sema-legal, so v001 was deleted,
`latest_version` reverted to `000`, and v000's docs improved to state the
supervisor health-monitoring purpose. This is supervisor liveness, distinct from
the cross-party SCADA↔LTN contract heartbeat — see
`wiki/gridworks-scada/research/concerns/liveness-and-sla.md`.
